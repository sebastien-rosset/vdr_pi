= VDR Log Format Specification

== Overview
This specification defines a CSV-based format for logging NMEA0183, NMEA2000, and SignalK data. The format follows the RFC 4180 CSV specification.

== File Format

=== Basic Format

Data is encoded using CSV format as specified in link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt[RFC 4180].

* UTF-8 encoding - Required for compatibility with SignalK JSON data which mandates UTF-8 encoding.
  See link:https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/data_model.html[Signal K Data Model].
* Line endings: CRLF (\r\n)
* Fields are separated by comma (,)
* Fields containing special characters (comma, quotes, newlines) must be enclosed in double quotes.
* Double quotes within fields must be escaped by doubling: `""`
* File extension should be `.csv`

Note: UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII.

=== Comments
* Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored
* Comments can appear anywhere in the file
* Comments are useful for metadata and documentation
* Comments must appear on their own line

=== Header
* First non-comment line must contain the CSV header as specified in link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt[RFC 4180]
* Header defines the field names for the columns
* Field names are case-sensitive

=== Forward Compatibility
* Parsers must not assume fixed positions for fields
* Field positions should be determined by reading the CSV header
* Parsers must ignore unknown fields
* Additional fields may be added in future versions of this specification
* All required fields must be present, but their order may vary

== Required Header Fields

=== timestamp_format
* Required field specifying how timestamps are encoded
* Valid values: 
  - ISO8601 (Example: 2024-02-16T10:00:00.123Z)
  - EPOCH_SECONDS (Example: 1708074000)
  - EPOCH_MILLIS (Example: 1708074000123)
* Must be specified in header comment for the file
* All timestamps in the file must use the same format

== Required CSV Fields

=== received_at
* Indicates when the message was received/logged by the system. Note this might be different from the time when the source instrument generated the data.
* Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format – specifically the RFC 3339 extension format, which is slightly more strict than the ISO specification.
* Timestamps have millisecond precision in UTC.
* Format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
* This format matches SignalK timestamp requirements (RFC 3339)
* Example: `2024-02-16T10:00:00.123Z`
* Timestamp assignment:
** For messages that include their own timestamp (like SignalK updates or NMEA2000 PGNs with time fields):
   - The log timestamp should be when the message was received/logged
   - The original message timestamp is preserved in the raw_data field
** For messages without timestamps:
   - The log timestamp should be set as close as possible to when the message was received.
** Timestamps must be monotonically increasing.
** Time jumps may occur when:
   - System time is updated (e.g., GPS fix acquired)
   - Time source changes

=== protocol
* Enumerated string
* Valid values: `NMEA0183`, `NMEA2000`, `SignalK`
* Case sensitive

=== msg_type
* Identifier for the specific type of message, format depends on protocol:
  - NMEA0183: Combined talker ID and sentence type (e.g., "GPGGA")
  - NMEA2000: PGN in decimal format (e.g., "61184")
  - SignalK: The primary path from the update (e.g., "navigation.speedThroughWater")
* Must be extracted from the raw_data
* Case-sensitive
* For malformed messages where the protocol cannot be extracted, field should be empty

=== source
* String identifier for the physical or logical data source.
* Examples:
  - `ttyUSB0`
  - `CAN0`
  - `"TCP 192.168.1.1:8375"`
  - `COM3`

=== raw_data
* Format depends on protocol:
  - NMEA0183: Complete sentence including checksum
  - NMEA2000: Hex bytes including header, CAN ID
  - SignalK: Complete JSON delta message with proper CSV escaping

== Optional Fields

=== sent_at
* Optional timestamp from the source that generated the data, such as the instrument or gateway.
* Same format as timestamp
* Source depends on protocol:
  - NMEA2000: Timestamp from PGN if available
  - NMEA0183: Time field from sentence if available
  - SignalK: timestamp field from gateway
* May be empty if source has no timestamp.
* The sequence of source_timestamp may not be in chronological order because they may be emitted by different instruments.

== Raw Message Logging
* All messages must be logged exactly as received, without modification
* This includes:
  - Messages with invalid checksums
  - Messages with incorrect formats
  - Messages with invalid characters
  - Incomplete or truncated messages
  - Messages with incorrect field counts
  - Messages with out-of-range values
* No filtering or correction should be applied to the raw_data field

=== Purpose
High-fidelity logging enables:
* Troubleshooting of communication issues
* Analysis of device behavior
* Exact replay of problematic sequences
* Verification of data quality
* Debugging of protocol implementations
